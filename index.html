        Howdy! my name is Neil Arthur B.Divinagracia and I am currently a student at Silliman University trying to earn my BSCS degree. I've always been fascinated with computers even at a<br>
		young age and that same feeling had never once wavered from me. My hobbies typically include a variety of subjects such as reading, writing, drawing, coding, exercising etc. I'm definitely<br> not the best at coding and quite frankly, I feel somewhat burnt out by it considering that I've never been the type of person to enjoy what other people tell them to make but regardless, I'm always willing to learn.<br> I also enjoy doing other computer related activities such as hacking and video games.
