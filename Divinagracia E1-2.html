	 <p> My primary goal for this year is mainly to achieve honors so I can prove to myself that I am more than what I think I am. <br>
	 For most of my life, I have doubted both my academic and technical skills and seek to reevaluate what it means to a person in my position. <br>
	 I want to better improve my physical and mental state by instilling a superior work ethic and study habits to reach my goal. </p> <br> <br> <br> <br>
