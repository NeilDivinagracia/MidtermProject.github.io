                            I've quite the handful of hobbies: I like to read, write stories, draw, play video games, working out (irregularly), watch movies and anime, and just about anything that makes me feel at ease with myself. 
							On the topic of gaming, I usually play games that exist outside of the mainstream here in the Philippines. I've played the games that are by far the most prominent here such as Mobile Legends, Genshin Impact,
							Valorant, and many more but I personally feel they pale in comparison to the kind of games that are available on both PC and console. Some of my favorite games include Mass Effect, Bioshock, Dragon Age, Witcher 3, 
							Fallout New Vegas, and a whole lot more. I'd say that my favorite sport is badminton and that's pretty much the only sport I love playing. Mostly because it was the one sport that I wasn't absolutely terrible at.
							I was first exposed to it by my cousin where we'd play out in the streets and she'd teach me the rules and everything there was to know about the sport. Eventually, during the summer of grade 6, I took badminton 
							classes and was apparently skilled enough to win a medal for "Most Talented Player". Unfortunately, I sorta stopped playing after that time due to lost interest, and it's been years since I've picked up a racket 
							but I'd like to imagine that I've still got the talent for it somewhere. The only social media I use is Facebook, Discord, and sometimes Reddit. I've never had a Twitter account because it doesn't really make sense 
							for me to have one since only a handful of people I know use it and I've always held the belief that Instagram is for posers (hehe). On a sidenote, I'm an introvert but I don't find a problem with socializing and 
							depending on my mood, I'm either somewhat approachable or a downright brick wall. <br> <br>
							
							<b style="font-size:40px; background-color:lightgreen;">Talents:</b><br><br>
							I personally don't believe I was gifted with any talent. Talents are given to those who were destined for greatness and I don't see myself upon that list. <br> <br>
							
						    <b style="font-size:40px; background-color:Tomato;">Skills:</b><br><br>
							These include: Coding(to an extent), drawing, psychoanalysis, observant, adaptability, digital literacy etc.
