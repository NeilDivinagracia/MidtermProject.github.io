     <td colspan = 3 style= "text-align:left; font-family:helvetica;"> <b style = "font-size:40px; background-color:Red;"> About Myself... </b> <br> <br> I've quite the handful of hobbies: I like to read, write stories, draw, play video games, working out(irregularly), watch movies and anime and just about anything that makes me feel at ease with myself. On the topic of gaming, I usually play games that exists outside of the mainstream here in the Philippines. I've played the games that are by far the most prominent here such as Mobile Legends, Genshin Impact, Valorant and many more but I personally feel they pale in comparison to the kind of games that are available on both PC and console. Some of my favorite games include Mass Effect, Bioshock, Dragon Age, Witcher 3, Fallout New Vegas and a whole lot more. I'd say that my favorite sport is badminton and that's pretty much the only sport I love playing. Mostly because it was the one sport that I wasn't absolutely terrible at. I was first exposed to it by my cousin where we'd play out in the streets and she'd teach me the rules and everything there was to know about the sport. Eventually, during the summer of grade 6, I took badminton classes and was apparently skilled enough to win a medal for "Most Talented Player". Unfortunately, I sorta stopped playing after that time due to lost interest and it's been years since I've picked up a racket but I'd like to imagine that I've still got the talent for it somewhere. The only social media I use is Facebook, Discord and sometimes Reddit. I've never had a twitter account because it doesn't really make sense for me to have one since only a handful of people I know use it and I've always held the belief that Instagram is for posers(hehe). on a sidenote, I'm an introvert but I don't find a problem with socializing and depending on my mood, I'm either somewhat approachable or a downright brickwall.</td>
